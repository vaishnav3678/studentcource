## 2. Key Architecture & Features

### Original Branding
- Original round **Pathfinder** insignia preserved without distortion or recreation across the navbar, login screens, student dashboard, and admin console.

### Minimal White-Themed Landing Page
- Minimalist layout focused solely on the Pathfinder logo, a short welcome headline, brief portal description, the two flagship course cards, and the primary **Student Login** action.
- Free of cluttered statistics, marketing fluff, or public admin controls.
- Small, unobtrusive **Admin Access** link in the footer.

### Desktop Video Uploads
- Direct local computer file upload supporting **MP4** and **WebM** formats up to 500MB.
- Real-time progress bar feedback with file size and upload status.
- Persisted locally via browser IndexedDB (`PathfinderMediaDB`) and integrated with Supabase Storage (`course-videos` bucket).
- Alternative **Add Video URL** mode allows attaching protected stream or external video links.

### PDF Notes & Resources
- Direct PDF upload from desktop attached to specific courses, modules, and lessons.
- In-browser document view and offline download buttons.

### Live Masterclass Meetings
- Schedule Google Meet, Zoom, or Teams sessions with live links, date, time, and instructions.
- Visible only to actively enrolled students for that specific track.

### Strict Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Students enrolled in Full Stack cannot view Manual Testing content or meetings, and vice-versa.
- Admin dashboard is protected and inaccessible to student accounts.

## 3. Important persistence and production deployment note

The default Express API in this ZIP currently stores structured data in `data/pathfinder_db.json` and uploaded files under `data/uploads/`. This is suitable for local development or a single persistent server, but **it is not durable shared cloud storage on ephemeral/serverless hosts such as a default Vercel deployment**. The Supabase connection helper and SQL schema are present, but the current REST API routes still use the local JSON database; adding Supabase environment variables alone does not migrate these routes or uploaded files to Supabase.

For multi-device production use, connect the API routes to a shared database and private object storage (for example, Supabase Postgres + Storage), configure server-side authorization/RLS, and verify the provider's storage and bandwidth limits. Do not treat browser IndexedDB, local JSON, or a server temporary directory as the production source of truth.

## 4. Supabase Cloud Configuration (setup reference)

To prepare a Supabase instance:

1. Create a project at [supabase.com](https://supabase.com).
2. Open the **SQL Editor** and execute `supabase/migrations/20261009_pathfinder_schema.sql`.
3. Create two storage buckets in **Storage**:
   - `course-videos` (Private, 500MB limit)
   - `course-pdfs` (Private, 50MB limit)
4. Add credentials to your `.env`:
   ```bash
   VITE_SUPABASE_URL="https://your-project.supabase.co"
   VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY="your-anon-key"
   ```

npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production (Vercel / Cloud Run)
npm run build
```
